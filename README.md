## Description

  This project is a backend API for a social networking site. The main objective in building this API was to take my first venture into the world of NoSql, using MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM. The application tier was created with Node.js and Express.js and the routes were tested with Insomnia. 

  The application is simple; users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. The User model populates cooresponding thoughts and friends when called, and the Thought model populates and stores reactions to those thoughts via the reaction schema.
