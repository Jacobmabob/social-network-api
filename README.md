  ## Description

  This project is a CMS style blog site created with Node.js, Express.js, and MySql. It is built using MVC architecture and is a basic CRUD application with User authentication. Users are able to create an account, enabling them to create/update/delete their own blog posts and leave comments on posts created by others.

  ## Usage
   
   When users visit the site, they are presented with a list of every blog post. Each post features a title, body, the username of the user who created it and the date on which it was originally created. Users can then click on any post and are taken a page that displays the post and any comments that have been left on that post. To access any other features, the User must create an account.

   Once a User has created an account, they are able access their dashboard. From the dashboard, the User can create their own blog posts or update/delete existing posts. Registered Users are also able to leave comments on others posts. Exciting!
